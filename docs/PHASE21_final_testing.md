# Phase 21 — Final Testing

**Status:** Checklist written. Not yet executed — every check below needs
a real run on your machine, following this whole project's established
pattern: nothing here is marked passed until you've actually run it and
reported the real numbers back.

---

## Why a checklist, not a test suite

Given the project's scale (22,075 real rows, a real HDFS/Spark/Hive
cluster, live external RSS calls), a from-scratch automated test suite
would either need to mock most of the real infrastructure (defeating the
point of end-to-end testing) or take longer to build than it saves. This
checklist instead re-runs and cross-checks the real commands from every
earlier phase, in order, verifying each phase's output still matches its
own documented "expect N" values after all of Phase 13-20's changes.

Run these in order. If any step's actual output doesn't match its
"Expect" line, stop and report the exact numbers before continuing -
don't assume a later step will mask an earlier discrepancy.

## 1 — Infrastructure sanity

```bash
jps
```
Expect: NameNode, DataNode, SecondaryNameNode, ResourceManager,
NodeManager all present (see docs/PHASE04_hadoop_hdfs_hive.md).

```bash
hdfs dfs -ls /startup-survival/processed/startups/
```
Expect: `labeled_eligible_startups.csv` present.

## 2 — Re-verify row counts end to end

```bash
cd ~/startup-survival-prediction/scala
sbt "runMain com.startupsurvival.spark.StartupRDD"
```
Expect: `Total startups loaded: 22075`, `label=0 -> 2902, label=1 -> 19173`
— must match Phase 6's Python/Scala parity check exactly. Any drift here
invalidates every downstream phase.

## 3 — Re-verify the join

```bash
sbt "runMain com.startupsurvival.spark.FeatureJoin" 2>&1 | tee /tmp/join_run.txt
grep -a "Financial features\|Sentiment features\|Combined features\|coverage\|baseline\|Expect\|label=" /tmp/join_run.txt
```
Expect (per docs/PHASE13_feature_join.md, post-cleanup):
```
Financial features built for: 22075 startups
Sentiment features built for: 3 startups
Combined features: 22075 startups
Startups with real news coverage: 3
Startups with zero-baseline sentiment: 22072
```
**This is the step that previously caught two real bugs** (Instructure's
missing headline text, and Sifteo's genuine ineligibility) - it is not a
formality, it is the check most likely to surface a real problem.

## 4 — Feature sets

```bash
sbt "runMain com.startupsurvival.spark.FeatureSets"
```
Expect: both `financialOnlyDF` and `financialSentimentDF` show
`22075` rows. Spot-check a couple of printed rows against the raw
FinancialFeatures/SentimentFeatures values from step 3's output — the
vector encoding should be traceable by hand for at least one startup
(e.g. Kabbage), the same way every earlier phase's transformation was
hand-verified.

## 5 — Models train without error

```bash
sbt "runMain com.startupsurvival.ml.LogisticRegression"
sbt "runMain com.startupsurvival.ml.SVM"
```
Expect: both complete without exceptions, print train/test row counts
that sum to 22075 for each experiment, and print coefficients for every
named feature (no `NaN` coefficients — a `NaN` here usually means a
feature column is constant or contains an unhandled missing value that
slipped past Phase 14/15's imputation).

## 6 — Full evaluation run

```bash
sbt "runMain com.startupsurvival.ml.Evaluation"
cat ../results/experiment_results.csv
```
Expect: 4 rows in the CSV (Experiments 1-4), each with `accuracy` and
`auc` between 0 and 1, and `tp+tn+fp+fn` equal to that row's `test_count`.
**Record the actual numbers here once you've run this** — this is the
first point in the whole project where real experiment results exist,
and they belong in the report's Results section (report/results.md),
not just in this checklist.

## 7 — Visualizations

```bash
cd ~/startup-survival-prediction
python -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate   # if not already set up
pip install -r requirements.txt
python visualization/plot_results.py
```
Expect: 4 PNG files written to `visualization/`, and the printed table
matches step 6's CSV exactly (this script reads that CSV directly, so a
mismatch here would mean the file was edited or a stale copy is present
elsewhere).

## 8 — Dashboard smoke test

```bash
cd ~/startup-survival-prediction
python -m http.server 8000
# open http://localhost:8000/dashboard/ in a browser
```
Expect: the four charts and the confusion-matrix grid render with the
same numbers as step 6/7 - not the "No results loaded yet" empty state.
If the empty state shows, check the browser console for a fetch error
before assuming the CSV is missing (some browsers still block relative
fetches even over `http://` depending on directory structure - the
file-picker fallback on the page exists specifically for this case).

## 9 — Re-read the report against real numbers

Once steps 6-8 produce real numbers, re-read `report/results.md` and
`report/discussion.md` (Phase 22) and confirm every claimed number
traces back to something actually printed in this checklist - not a
number written before the real run happened.

## What "done" looks like

Every step above executed once, with its real output pasted back and
checked against its "Expect" line, in this same order. Mark this doc
Complete only after that - not after the code compiles, which step 5
alone does not guarantee (a model can train "successfully" on
nonsensical features and still produce meaningless output; steps 6-9 are
what actually catch that).
